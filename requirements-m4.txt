# M4: Physics Loss Requirements
# Differentiable Physics Regularization

# Base requirements (M3)
-r requirements-m3.txt

# Sionna (optional, only needed for radio map generation)
# Uncomment if you want to generate radio maps from scratch
# sionna>=0.15.0

# Note: Sionna RT requires:
# - CUDA-capable GPU
# - Mitsuba 3
# - Dr.Jit
# See: https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/install.html

# For using precomputed radio maps (training only), Sionna is NOT required
# Physics loss uses precomputed maps stored in Zarr format
